7. **Firebase Performance Monitoring** (30 minutes)
   - Track app performance
   - Identify bottlenecks

8. **Bulk Actions** (2-3 hours)
   - Select multiple items

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Firebase Integration
1. **Always use singleton pattern** - Prevents multiple app instances
2. **Validate environment variables** - Fail fast with clear errors
3. **Use onSnapshot for real-time** - Better UX than polling
4. **Clean up listeners** - Return unsubscribe in useEffect

### Error Handling
1. **Toast notifications** - Immediate user feedback
2. **Console logging** - Developer debugging
3. **Error state management** - UI can respond appropriately
4. **Try-catch everywhere** - Graceful degradation

### Security
1. **Firestore rules are crucial** - Server-side validation
2. **Client-side checks** - Better UX, not security
3. **Admin role in Firestore** - Single source of truth
4. **Environment variables** - Never commit secrets

### Performance
1. **Index your queries** - Essential for production
2. **Limit data fetching** - Don't load everything
3. **Real-time where needed** - Not everywhere
4. **Cleanup subscriptions** - Prevent memory leaks
