<!-- Emphasis -->
<p>This is <strong>bold text</strong> and this is <em>italic text</em>.</p>

<!-- Lists -->
<ul>
  <li>Unordered list item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Ordered list item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
</ol>

<!-- Links -->
<p>Check out <a href="https://example.com">this link</a>.</p>

<!-- Images -->
<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Description" />

<!-- Blockquotes -->
<blockquote>
  This is a quote from someone important.
</blockquote>

<!-- Code -->
<p>Use <code>code</code> for inline code.</p>
<pre><code>
// Code block
function example() {
  return "Hello World";
}
</code></pre>
```

## Firebase Configuration

### Deploying Security Rules

After implementing the blog system, deploy the security rules:

```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage:rules

# Deploy both
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

### Firestore Security

The Firestore rules ensure that:
- Anyone can read published blogs
- Only admins can read drafts
- Only admins can create, update, or delete blogs

### Storage Security

The Storage rules ensure that:
- Anyone can read blog images
- Only admins can upload blog images
- Maximum file size is 5MB
- Only image files are accepted

## Styling

The blog system uses:
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: For consistent component design
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations
- **Dark Mode**: Full support via next-themes

### Customization

To customize the blog design:

1. **Colors**: Modify in `tailwind.config.ts`
2. **Card Style**: Edit `frontend/components/home/blog-section.tsx`
3. **Typography**: Adjust prose classes in `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js `Image` component
- **Lazy Loading**: Blog section loads on scroll
- **Caching**: Firebase caches frequently accessed documents
- **Real-time Updates**: Only subscribe when necessary

## SEO Best Practices

1. **Unique Titles**: Each blog should have a unique, descriptive title
2. **Meta Descriptions**: Use summaries (20-200 chars) for descriptions
3. **Featured Images**: Always include high-quality featured images
4. **Structured Content**: Use proper HTML headings (h2, h3)
5. **Internal Links**: Link between related blog posts
6. **Clean URLs**: Auto-generated slugs are SEO-friendly

## Troubleshooting

### Blog not appearing on homepage
- Check that blog status is "published"
- Verify Firestore rules are deployed
- Check browser console for errors

### Image upload failing
- Ensure image is under 5MB
- Check that Storage rules are deployed
- Verify Firebase Storage is enabled in console

### Real-time updates not working
- Check Firebase initialization in `lib/firebase.ts`
- Verify network connection
- Check browser console for errors
